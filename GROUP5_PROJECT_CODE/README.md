# CBIR--Content-Based-Image-Retrieval
Java (NetBeans Project) - CBIR System - HSV Color Histogram based

      Â· Implemented a CBIR system in Java, which was able to query an image over a database of images and return a set of results, that  
         most closely matched the color content of the queried image. Used an efficient approach to index the image database, based on the 
         HSV color domain, rather than the RGB domain, in order to effectively tone down the size of the images in the database. Applied 
         efficient OOP principles in order to design and implement the image database as a serializable HashMap, with the unique 
         md5 checksum of the images acting as a key in the HashMap. Implemented a simple Java Swing GUI, to act as an interface for 
         the application.
